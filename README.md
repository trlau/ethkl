# zkJ0M - Zero Knowledge Prediction Market

## Problem Statement 🏇📈
In horse racing betting, the influence of team popularity on sentiment bias can greatly distort sports betting odds, leading to the potential misguidance of public bets and the creation of skewed markets. This problem is evident in traditional sports betting and can result in concerns about fair play, dissatisfaction with manipulated odds, and a desire for a transparent betting environment.

### Betting Process:
1. **User Bets:**
    - Place Bets: Users place bets on possible outcomes.
    - Prize Pool: All bets contribute to a collective prize pool.

2. **Determining Winners:**
    - Outcome: Once the event concludes, the winning outcome is determined.
    - Winners: Identify users who bet on the winning outcome.

3. **Payout Distribution:**
    - Calculate Share: Divide the total prize pool by the number of winning bets.
    - Distribute Winnings: Pay out the calculated share to each winner.

4. **Platform Commission:**
    - Deduct Commission: Take a predetermined percentage from the prize pool as platform revenue.
    - Net Prize Pool: The remaining amount is distributed among the winners.

**Example:**
- Total Prize Pool: $10,000
- Platform Commission: 10% ($1,000)
- Net Prize Pool: $9,000
- Winners: 90
- Payout per Winner: $9,000 / 90 = $100
